# Hooks Folder in Next.js 14

## Overview

The **`hooks`** folder in a Next.js 14 project is used to store custom React hooks. Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across various components in your application. This folder helps organize and centralize logic that can be shared among components, promoting code reusability, modularity, and cleaner component structure.

Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic (such as data fetching, form handling, or accessing browser APIs) into reusable functions, making your components easier to maintain and understand.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the **`hooks`** folder is to:

- Provide a single place to store all custom hooks.
- Reuse logic across multiple components without duplicating code.
- Keep components clean by separating logic (especially side effects) from the UI.
- Organize application logic in a modular and scalable way.
