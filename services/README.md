## Services Folder Purpose

The **`services`** folder serves the following purposes:

- **Encapsulation of Logic**: It isolates business logic and API interactions from UI components, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Modularity**: By organizing code into services, the application becomes more modular, allowing for easier testing, maintenance, and reusability.
- **Centralized API Management**: It centralizes all API calls and related logic, making it easier to modify endpoints or handling logic as the application evolves.

## Fetcher Subfolder Purpose

The **`fetcher`** subfolder within **`services`** is dedicated to defining functions that handle data fetching from APIs. This includes constructing API requests, handling responses, and managing error states.

### Key Files

1. **`api.js`**:

   - This file contains functions that define how to make API calls. Each function typically corresponds to a specific endpoint or resource.
   - The functions here can be designed to fetch, create, update, or delete data as needed.

2. **`config.js`**:
   - This file holds configuration details such as base URLs for APIs, authentication tokens, or other settings that might be used throughout your fetcher functions.
   - Centralizing configuration helps ensure consistency and ease of updates.

### Example Structure Breakdown

#### **`api.js`**

This file may contain functions like:

```js
// services/fetcher/api.js

import { API_BASE_URL } from './config';

// Function to fetch all items from an API
export async function fetchItems() {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/items`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch items');
  }
  return response.json();
}

// Function to fetch a specific item by ID
export async function fetchItemById(itemId) {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/items/${itemId}`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch item with ID ${itemId}`);
  }
  return response.json();
}
```
