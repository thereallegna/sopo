## **shared Folder**

### Purpose:

The **`shared`** folder contains components that can be reused across multiple parts of the application. These components are general-purpose and not tied to a specific feature or menu.

### Usage:

- Components in the `shared` folder are commonly used in various pages and modules, such as headers, footers, modal dialogs, and other reusable UI elements.
- By placing these components in `shared`, you ensure they are easy to find and maintain since they are not bound to any specific module.
