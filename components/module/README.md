## **module Folder**

### Purpose:

The **`module`** folder is used to store components that are specific to certain sections or features of the application. Each subfolder under `module` is related to a particular menu or feature of the application.

### Usage:

- Components in the `module` folder are not intended for use across the entire application, but rather within a specific section.
- For example, if you have a **BudgetRequest** section or menu in your application, all components related only to the **BudgetRequest** feature should be placed in `module/BudgetRequest`.
