# Libs Folder in Next.js 14

## Overview

The **`libs`** (short for "libraries") folder in a Next.js 14 project is used to store utility functions, helper libraries, or reusable logic that is shared across different parts of the application. This folder is ideal for keeping your code modular, organized, and reusable, helping to maintain a clean separation between core application logic and reusable utilities.

By centralizing shared functions and utilities in the `libs` folder, the application can avoid duplication and maintain a consistent codebase.

## Folder Purpose

The **`libs`** folder is designed to store:

- **Utility Functions**: General-purpose helper functions that are used across multiple components or pages (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation, data processing).
- **API Wrappers**: Functions that handle API requests, typically abstracting HTTP requests and responses into reusable methods.
- **Business Logic**: Functions that contain business logic, such as data transformation or validation logic that can be reused across various features.
- **Configuration Files**: Storing shared configuration logic or constants used throughout the application.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Any code related to third-party services (e.g., authentication, database queries, analytics, etc.).

## Folder Structure Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the **`libs`** folder might be structured in a Next.js 14 project:
